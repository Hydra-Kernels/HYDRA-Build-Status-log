- Clang Used for Performance(7.13-ext) : **Neutron- Ubuntu Clang**(Coz its stable for gaming, and will provide a good fps ) with blend of battery + stability
- Clang Used for Balanced + BB (7.13-BB) : **Azure - Clang** 

- Clang Used : https://gitlab.com/Panchajanya1999/azure-clang.git --depth=1
- Neutron clang (Ubuntu) for Gaming Stability

- **My thoughts : Amit(@amitkv1212) has already used a lot of DragonTc and Proton-Clang, but its time for the latest clangs**
